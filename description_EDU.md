### Data Information
* Archival data can be collected using.
* Experimental data are uploaded to [OSF folder](https://osf.io/f9rhq/) (S2, S4, and S5 sub-folders).

### Archival Data Processing & Analysis for Google Trends
* Step 1: <b> [GoogleTrends_data.ipynb](https://github.com/jinyan0425/inequality_related_projects/tree/google_trends/GoogleTrends_data.ipynb) </b> to collect data from Google Trends and analyze the data (dataset needed: <i> [df_gt_cov.csv](https://github.com/jinyan0425/inequality_related_projects/tree/google_trends/df_gt_cov.csv) </i>, <i> [df_un_master.csv](https://github.com/jinyan0425/inequality_related_projects/tree/google_trends/df_un_master.csv) </i>, <i> [df_exp_master.csv](https://github.com/jinyan0425/inequality_related_projects/tree/google_trends/df_exp_master.csv)</i>)

### Archival Data Processing & Analysis for Census, ACS
* Step 1: <b> [ACS_edu_data.ipynb](https://github.com/jinyan0425/inequality_related_projects/tree/census_acs/ACS_edu_data.ipynb) </b> to collect data from Census (dataset needed: <i> [df_un_master.csv](https://github.com/jinyan0425/inequality_related_projects/tree/census_acs/df_exp_master.csv)</i>)

* Step 2: <b> [ACS_edu_analysis.R](https://github.com/jinyan0425/inequality_related_projects/tree/census_acs/ACS_edu_analysis.R) </b> to analyze the education data (datasets needed:<i> [df_attain_master_1y.csv](https://github.com/jinyan0425/inequality_related_projects/tree/census_acs/df_attain_master_1y) </i>, <i> [df_attain_master_5y.csv](https://github.com/jinyan0425/inequality_related_projects/tree/census_acs/df_attain_master_5y) </i>, <i> [df_enroll_master_1y.csv](https://github.com/jinyan0425/inequality_related_projects/tree/census_acs/df_enroll_master_1y) </i>, <i> [df_enroll_master_5y.csv](https://github.com/jinyan0425/inequality_related_projects/tree/census_acs/df_enroll_master_5y)</i>)

### Archival Data Processing & Visualization for Census, ACS & NCES
* Step 1: <b> [ACS_major_data.ipynb](https://github.com/jinyan0425/inequality_related_projects/tree/major_visualization/ACS_major_data.ipynb) </b> to collect data from Census and <b> [NCES_major_data.ipynb](https://github.com/jinyan0425/inequality_related_projects/tree/major_visualization/NCES_major_data.ipynb)  </b> to process data collected from NCES (dataset needed: <i> [df_historic_income_inequality.csv](https://github.com/jinyan0425/inequality_related_projects/tree/major_visualization/df_historic_income_inequality.csv)</i>)
* Step 2: <b> ACS_major_data.ipynb </b> to visualize the relationship between cross-county-year and the proportion of the population with different fields of bachelor's degree for their first major and <b> NCES_major_data.ipynb </b> to visualize the relationship between historic Gini index and major conferred by higher institutions

### Experimental Data Analysis
* Experiments are analyzed using SPSS, and the syntax can be accessed through [OSF folder](https://osf.io/f9rhq/) (S2, S4, and S5 sub-folders).
