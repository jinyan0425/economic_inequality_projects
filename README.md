## General Description
This repository contains scripts for three projects studying different facets of economic inequality:

1. <b> Perception Bias:</b> explore to what extent people associate rising economic inequality with an increase in poverty (vs. affluence)

2. <b> Digital Discrimination in Sharing Economy:</b> examine how economic inequality in one's region affects their access to peer-to-peer services

3. <b> Education Decisions:</b> investigate how economic inequality in one's region affects their decision-making regarding higher education, including college decision (whether or not to attend college) and choice of major (which field to major in).

Data are available upon request as the manuscripts are under review. If you request additional information, please contact me @ [jinyan.xiang0425@gmail.com](jinyan.xiang0425@gmail.com).

## Project Descriptions

### [When People Talk About Income Inequality, What Are They Talking About? The Lay Understanding of Income Inequality](https://github.com/jinyan0425/inequality_related_projects/tree/inequality_poverty)
While prior research extensively examines <b><i> how </b></i> people perceive the level of inequality, little has been known about<b><i> what </b></i> inequality means to them. 

<b> A survey with a national representative sample, an controlled experiment and an implicit association test (IAT) provided convergent evidence that people associate income inequality more with poverty than with affluence. This constitutes a new form of misperception of income inequality </b> as, in reality, rising income inequality is more associated with an increase in the number of wealthy households rather than households living in poverty. 

<b> These findings may help policymakers resolve the paradox between people's perception of unfair income distribution and their resistance to redistribution and promote public support for wealth-equalization interventions by correcting this biased lay understanding. </b> 

In addition, we speculate that <b><i> availability heuristics (Tversky & Kahneman, 1974) </b></i> (e.g., poverty is more salient, concrete, and recallable) and <b><i>the negative halo effect (Cook et al., 2003) </b></i> (e.g., societies with higher income inequality are more likely to experience more socioeconomic issues including poverty) account for the development of this lay association.

### [Engagement in the Sharing Economy](https://github.com/jinyan0425/inequality_related_projects/tree/sharing_economy)
This project explores how economic inequality shapes consumers' engagement in the sharing economy from both user's and the provider's perspectives. </b> Using both archival data analysis and experiments in various sharing economy contexts (p2p lending, ridesharing, lodge-sharing) and using different manipulations of economic inequality and metrics/measures of consumers engagement, we document that <b> economic inequality discourages consumers' engagement through a lowered interpersonal trust in terms of both contribution and usage </b>. 

<b>These findings allude to potential discrimination and exclusion issues in the sharing economy that needs to be addressed by platforms and government policy innovation</b>. At the consumer level, providers and users from more unequal regions are likely stigmatized as untrustworthy and thus would be more vulnerable to unfair treatment such as the limited number of service requests from users and frequent and unexcused service rejections by providers (Edelman et al., 2017). At the regional level, regions with higher economic inequality would face more barriers to participating in and benefiting from this sustainable economic model due to a shrinking provider/user base and a lack of market vitality. Consequently, in the long run, the development of the sharing economy may be hindered by rising global economic inequality.

### Choices in Higher Education (to be updated)
This project explores how economic inequality shapes people's higher education decisions. <b> Leveraging Google Trend data, experimental data (i.e., education decision games, adapted from Payne et al., 2017, and trade-off tests), and US-county-level archival data (from Census), we find that economic inequality promotes people's choices in higher education through a greater perceived education premium (i.e., a more pronounced difference in earnings between the more and less educated) </b>. In addition, rising economic inequality drives people to prioritize their extrinsic motives (e.g., external rewards) over intrinsic ones (e.g., personal alignment). Consequently, they tend to choose the majors with higher earning potential but lower personal interest over those that align more closely with their interests but pay less.

At first blush, these findings suggest a surprising benefit of rising economic inequality. <b> However, on closer examination, they reveal that economic inequality actually hinders the establishment of a diverse and inclusive educational environment, as it discourages young individuals from pursuing fields of study that align with their true passion and talents. Instead, they are more likely to flock to high-paying majors, which aligns with the humanity crisis in recent years. Indeed, such education decisions are not only suboptimal for individuals but also for society as a whole, as collective intelligence is vital for ensuring long-term prosperity. </b> Therefore, creating preventive policies and nudges is critical to protect a vital and fair educational environment.
