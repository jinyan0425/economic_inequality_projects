## General Description
This repo contains scripts, data, and results for several projects regarding economic inequality, including how it how it is (but possibly biasedly) associated with poverty (vs. affluence) in people's mind, how it affects consumers' engagement in the sharing economy, and how it affects choices in higher education.

* Experimental designs can be found at the design folders. 
* Results can be found at the result folders (in pickle files and pdfs. 
* Shareable data can be found in the data folders.

## Project Descriptions

### [Inequality-Poverty Lay Associtation](https://github.com/jinyan0425/inequality_related_projects/tree/inequality_poverty)
This project explores how economic inequality is associated with poverty (vs. affluence) in a dynamic sense. <b> A survey with a national representive sample, a mixed-design experiment with the student sample, and a implict association test (IAT) provide convergent evidence that people associate with poverty more strongly than with affluence </b>. Such perception of the impacts of economic inequality has been largely ignored in the literature, but <b> has a direct influence on people’s attitudes towards distribution and related social movements that are essential to addressing e economic inequality and address its negative consequences </b>. We speculate that availability heuristics (Tversky & Kahneman, 1974)(e.g., poverty is more salient, concrete and recallable) and horns effect (Cook et al., 2003) account for the development of this lay association (e.g., more unequal societies are more likely to experience more socioeconomic issues including poverty).

### [Engagement in the Sharing Economy](https://github.com/jinyan0425/inequality_related_projects/tree/sharing_economy)
This project explores how economic inequality shapes consumer's engagement in the sharing economy from both user's and the provider's perspectives. </b> Using both archival data analysis and experiments in various sharing economy contexts (p2p lending, ridesharing, lodge-sharing and with different manipulations of economic inequality and metrics/measures of consumers engagement, we document that <b> economic inequality discourages consumers' engagement through a lowered interpersonal trust in terms of both contribution and usage </b> . 

<b>These findings allude to potential discrimination and exclusion issues in the sharing economy that needs to be addressed by platform's and goverment's policy innovation</b>. At the consumer level, providers and users from more unequal regions are likely stigmatized as untrustworthy and thus would be more vulnerable to unfair treatment such as the limited number of service requests from users and frequent and unexcused service rejections by providers (Edelman et al., 2017). At the regional level, regions with higher economic inequality would face more barriers to participating in and benefiting from this sustainable economic model due to a shrinking provider/user base and a lack of market vitality. Consequently, in the long run, the development of the sharing economy may be hindered by the rising global economic inequality.

### Choices in Higher Education (to be updated)
This project explores how economic inequality shapes consumers' higher education decisions. <b> Leveraging Google Trend data, experimental data (i.e., edcuation decision games, adapted from Payne et al., 2017) and US-county-level archival data, we find that economic inequality promotes consumers choices in higher education through a greater perceived education premium (i.e., a more significant difference in earnings between the more and less educated) </b>. In addition, when people have other stronger motives (e.g., contribution to the society) than the motive toward financial gain (propensity and situational factors determined) (Davies & Ercolani, 2020), the positive effect of economic inequality on choices in higher education will diminish. It is also expected to be weaker for low-paying (vs. high-paying) majors.

<b> At first blush, these findings suggest a surprising benefit of rising economic inequality. However, essentially, economic inequality likely impedes a diverse and inclusive educational environment because it motivates young people less likely to choose the field of study where their true passion and talent reside but flock to the high-paying majors. Such education decisions are less optimal not only for individuals but also for society at large, which relies on collective intelligence for long-term prosperity. </b> Therefore, it is critical to create preventive policies and nudges that protect a vital and fair educational environment.
