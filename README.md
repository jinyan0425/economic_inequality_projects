## General Description
This repo contains scripts, data, and results for several projects regarding economic inequality, including how it is (but possibly biasedly) associated with poverty (vs. affluence) in people's minds, how it affects consumers' engagement in the sharing economy, and how it affects choices in higher education. 

Note that these data were used for the first draft and the final version of the manuscript could be different. The latest data will not be published until the manuscripts are published.

* Experimental designs can be found in the design folders. 
* Results can be found in the result folders (in pickle files and pdfs. 
* Shareable data can be found in the data folders.

## Project Descriptions

### [Inequality-Poverty Lay Associtation](https://github.com/jinyan0425/inequality_related_projects/tree/inequality_poverty)
This project explores how economic inequality is associated with poverty (vs. affluence) in a dynamic sense. <b> A survey with a national representative sample, a mixed-design experiment with the student sample, and an implicit association test (IAT) provide convergent evidence that people associate with poverty more strongly than with affluence </b>. Such perception of the impacts of economic inequality has been largely ignored in the literature, but <b> has a direct influence on people’s attitudes towards distribution and related social movements that are essential to addressing economic inequality and its negative consequences </b>. We speculate that availability heuristics (Tversky & Kahneman, 1974)(e.g., poverty is more salient, concrete, and recallable) and horns effect (Cook et al., 2003) account for the development of this lay association (e.g., more unequal societies are more likely to experience more socioeconomic issues including poverty).

### [Engagement in the Sharing Economy](https://github.com/jinyan0425/inequality_related_projects/tree/sharing_economy)
This project explores how economic inequality shapes consumers' engagement in the sharing economy from both user's and the provider's perspectives. </b> Using both archival data analysis and experiments in various sharing economy contexts (p2p lending, ridesharing, lodge-sharing) and using different manipulations of economic inequality and metrics/measures of consumers engagement, we document that <b> economic inequality discourages consumers' engagement through a lowered interpersonal trust in terms of both contribution and usage </b>. 

<b>These findings allude to potential discrimination and exclusion issues in the sharing economy that needs to be addressed by platforms and government policy innovation</b>. At the consumer level, providers and users from more unequal regions are likely stigmatized as untrustworthy and thus would be more vulnerable to unfair treatment such as the limited number of service requests from users and frequent and unexcused service rejections by providers (Edelman et al., 2017). At the regional level, regions with higher economic inequality would face more barriers to participating in and benefiting from this sustainable economic model due to a shrinking provider/user base and a lack of market vitality. Consequently, in the long run, the development of the sharing economy may be hindered by rising global economic inequality.

### Choices in Higher Education (to be updated)
This project explores how economic inequality shapes people's higher education decisions. <b> Leveraging Google Trend data, experimental data (i.e., education decision games, adapted from Payne et al., 2017, and trade-off tests), and US-county-level archival data (from Census), we find that economic inequality promotes people's choices in higher education through a greater perceived education premium (i.e., a more pronounced difference in earnings between the more and less educated) </b>. In addition, rising economic inequality drives people to prioritize their extrinsic motives (e.g., external rewards) over intrinsic ones (e.g., personal alignment). Consequently, they tend to choose the majors with higher earning potential but lower personal interest over those that align more closely with their interests but pay less.

At first blush, these findings suggest a surprising benefit of rising economic inequality. <b> However, on closer examination, they reveal that economic inequality actually hinders the establishment of a diverse and inclusive educational environment, as it discourages young individuals from pursuing fields of study that align with their true passion and talents. Instead, they are more likely to flock to high-paying majors, which aligns with the humanity crisis in recent years. Indeed, such education decisions are not only suboptimal for individuals but also for society as a whole, as collective intelligence is vital for ensuring long-term prosperity. </b> Therefore, creating preventive policies and nudges is critical to protect a vital and fair educational environment.
